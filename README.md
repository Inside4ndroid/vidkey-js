# [NOT WORKING - NEEDS WORK]

# A Vidsrc Key Extraction Tool!

Hello! I'm Inside4ndroid, a passionate Software Developer. I love solving problems and recently vidsrc has been one of my pet peev's.

- ðŸ’¼ This is an edited version of the worstsource-keys repo by achraf2003.
- ðŸŒ± Currently in a state that works.

# Keys.json

- The application checks for new keys every 2 hours and will only update keys.json if keys have changed.
- You can obtain the keys from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Inside4ndroid/vidkey-js/main/keys.json`

## How To Use

- fork and then clone or just clone up to you.
- run npm install
- run npm run getkeys

it will run and generate a keys.json file :)
